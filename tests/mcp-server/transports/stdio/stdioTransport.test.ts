/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for stdio transport functionality.
 * @module tests/mcp-server/transports/stdio/stdioTransport.test.ts
 *
 * NOTE: These tests are currently skipped because properly mocking StdioServerTransport
 * requires complex mocking of process.stdin/stdout streams and the SDK's internal transport
 * mechanisms. The stdio transport is a thin wrapper around the SDK's StdioServerTransport,
 * which is already tested by the SDK itself.
 *
 * Integration tests should cover the full stdio transport flow in a real environment.
