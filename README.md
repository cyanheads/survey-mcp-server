## ‚ú® Features

This server is built on the [`mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) and inherits its rich feature set:

- **Declarative Tools**: Define capabilities in single, self-contained files. The framework handles registration, validation, and execution.
- **Robust Error Handling**: A unified `McpError` system ensures consistent, structured error responses.
- **Pluggable Authentication**: Secure your server with zero-fuss support for `none`, `jwt`, or `oauth` modes.
- **Abstracted Storage**: Swap storage backends (`in-memory`, `filesystem`, `Supabase`, `Cloudflare KV/R2`) without changing business logic.
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Deep insights with structured logging (Pino) and optional, auto-instrumented OpenTelemetry for traces and metrics.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built with `tsyringe` for a clean, decoupled, and testable architecture.
- **Edge-Ready**: Write code once and run it seamlessly on your local machine or at the edge on Cloudflare Workers.

Plus, specialized features for **Survey Management**:

- **LLM-Driven Surveys**: Tools provide rich context (progress, next suggested questions, validation results) to guide natural conversation flow.
- **Hybrid Flow Control**: Guided mode with 3-5 suggested questions + flexible ordering based on conversation context.
- **Conditional Logic**: Skip logic and branching based on previous answers with real-time eligibility updates.
- **JSON-Based Survey Definitions**: Define surveys in simple JSON files with recursive directory scanning.
- **Multiple Question Types**: Free-form text, multiple choice, rating scales, email, number, and boolean questions.
- **Validation Engine**: Min/max length, patterns, required fields, and custom constraints.
- **Session Resume**: Built-in state management allows participants to pause and continue later.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Capabilities: Survey Tools

This server equips AI agents with specialized tools to conduct dynamic, conversational surveys while maintaining structured data collection.

### Example Interaction Flow

```
1. LLM calls survey_start_session
   ‚Üí Receives full survey context, all questions, and first 3-5 suggested questions

2. LLM asks questions naturally in conversation
   ‚Üí Follows suggestions but can adapt order based on context
   ‚Üí Uses natural language while ensuring survey questions are covered

3. For each answer, LLM calls survey_submit_response
   ‚Üí Receives validation feedback (re-prompts if needed)
   ‚Üí Gets progress update (50% complete, 2 of 4 questions answered)
   ‚Üí Refreshed suggestions with newly eligible conditional questions

4. LLM can check survey_get_progress anytime
   ‚Üí Knows exactly what's required vs optional
   ‚Üí Understands what remains before completion is possible

5. When all required questions answered, LLM calls survey_complete_session
   ‚Üí Session finalized with timestamp and summary
   ‚Üí Ready for export via survey_export_results
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Agent Development Guide

For strict rules when using this server with an AI agent, refer to the **`.clinerules`** file (or `AGENTS.md`) in this repository. Key principles include:

- **Logic Throws, Handlers Catch**: Never use `try/catch` in your tool `logic`. Throw an `McpError` instead.
- **Pass the Context**: Always pass the `RequestContext` object through your call stack for logging and tracing.
- **Use the Barrel Exports**: Register new tools and resources only in the `index.ts` barrel files within their respective `definitions` directories.
